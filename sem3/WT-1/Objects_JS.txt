Objects in JavaScript
---------------------

1. An object is JavaScript is a collection of properties.

2. Objects are used for collection of data.

3. Everything in JavaScript is considered as an object.

4. JavaScript is also called object based language.

5. Examples of objects can be laptop,mouse,keyboard,person  etc.

6. Objects can be changed or mutable in JavaScript.

7. Objects can be simple data type or mutable data type.

8.  Simple are unchanged.Simple are also called primitive.

9.  Number,string,boolean etc. are simple data type.

10. The state of the object which can be modified after it is created is called mutable object.

11. The state of the object which can not be modified after it is created is called immutable object.

12. Arrays and functions are examples of mutable object.

13. Objects can be variables.

14. Objects can contain more than one value.

15. var name= { firstname: "abc",lastname: "def",midddlename : "ghi", age: 21 ,gender: "male"}

16.  Object name is  "name" in point number 15.

17. Properties in point number  15 are firstname,lastname,middlename,age,gender.

18. Values in  point number  15 are abc,def,ghi,21,male.

19. The  actions that can be performed on an object are called methods.

20. Object method is an object property containing the definition of function.

21.  The named values in JavaScript objects are called properties.

22.  With the help of JavaScript,we can define and create our own objects.

23.  There are different ways to create new objects.

				--> Using object literal
                                --> Using keyword 'new'
                                --> Define the object constructor and create objects
                                    of the constructur type.


24.  Using object literal, we can create and define on object in one statement.

        Example :  var name= { firstname: "abc",lastname: "def",midddlename : "ghi", age: 21 ,gender: "male"}

                  Where object literal  syntax is  property name : value
                                        Example : gender : "male"

25.  Using keyword new,the object can be defined and created with the following statement.

          Example :       var name= new object();
                           name.firstname ="abc";
                           name.lastname="def";
                           name.middlename="ghi";
                           name.age=21;
                           name.gender="male";

26.  The point number 24 is equal to point number 25.

27. Objects are mutable.They are addressed by reference.

          Example:  var name= { firstname: "abc",lastname: "def",midddlename : "ghi", age: 21 ,gender: "male"}
                    Var a = name;
                   
          Please note :  In the above example,if i change the value of a , the same change will happen to name.
                         Because, a and name are the same object.

                Example :  var name= { firstname: "abc",lastname: "def",midddlename : "ghi", age: 21 ,gender: "male"}

                          Var a = name;
                          a.gender="female";
                        This gender value will be changed in both the objects,i.e., name and a .

28. The delete keyword deletes the property of an object.

                   Example : delete name.age;


29. In an object ,the keyword 'this' can be used.

         Example : var name= { firstname: "abc",lastname: "def",midddlename : "ghi",fullname : function() {
                                 return this.firstname + " " + this.middlename +" " + this.lastname; } }
          
               In this example , this refers to the object called name.
                                 The method fullname belongs to the name object.
                              The fullname will return the abc ghi def.


30.    x= name.fullname();

       The above command will return abc ghi def.

31.    x= name.fullname;
     
       The above command will return  the following output.
          
           return this.firstname + " " + this.middlename +" " + this.lastname; }   


32. DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL      (  DOM )
  ---------------------------

		---> Using DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.
                ---> The browser always creates a DOM of the page when a web page is loaded.
                --->  A tree of objects in JavaScript is called a DOM.  
                ---> This model is nothing but a standard for accessing documents.
               ----> The HTML DOM means the following.
                           :--- How to change,delete and add HTML elements.
