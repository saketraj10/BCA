CSS
----------
1. The full form of CSS is cascading Style sheet.
2. CSS is helpful for making the style of the web page.
3. It is used to make the web page more presentable.
4. There are three ways of inserting a style sheet. They are
              I. Internal CSS
             II. External  CSS
             III. Inline CSS

5. Internal CSS
--------------------

 ---> This type of style sheet is used if one single HTML page has a unique style.
 ----> This style is defined using the <style> element which is inside the head section.
 


Example : <html> <head> <style>
           body { background color: red; }
           h1 { color : maroon;
                margin-left: 20px; }
             </style>
                 </head> <body> <h1> CUO</h1>
                 <p> Koraput</p>
                    </body> </html>

6. External CSS
--------------------
----> Using external style sheet,the structure of website can be changed by changing one file.
----> In external CSS,each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet.
----> This reference is done using <link> element inside the head section.


Example : <html>
          <head>
         < link rel="stylesheet" href="style1.css">
           </head>
           <body>
                 <h1> CUO</h1>
                 <p> Koraput</p>
           </body>
            </html>

----> An external style sheet can be written in any text editor and must be saved in .css extension.
----> The external style sheet should not contain tags.
 
 Example :  style1.css
            --------------
               body {
                background-color:blue;
                 }
              h1 {
               color: red;
                 margin-left: 20px;
                }


7. Inline CSS
------------------

-----> This type of style sheet is used to apply a unique style for a single element.
-----> It uses the style attribute for the appropriate element.

Example : <html>
          <body>
         <h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">
            This is my inline CSS program</h1>
         <p style="color:red;">This my  CUO,Koraput</p>
            </body>
             </html>


CSS PROPERTIES IN A TABLE
-------------------------
1. A table is a cross section of rows and columns.
2. To make the table more stylish,CSS concept can be used.
3. To give borders in table, use the property of CSS called,  border  property.
         
           Example :  table,th,td
                       {  border: 10 px solid red;
                       }
4. If the width of the table is used entirely, use width property.
          Example : table { 
                    width: 100%;
                    }
5.  If we want to convert the table borders into a single border,the property of CSS
     which is used is called border-collapse.

          Example : table {
                     border-collapse: collapse;
                      }

6.  The space between the cell content and its borders,the property of CSS
     which is used is called padding.
         Example : th,td {
                   padding: 10px;
                    }
7. To align the table headings towards left,the property of CSS
     which is used is called text-align.

	Example : th{
                   text-align: left;
                    }
8. The spacing between the cells can be given using border-spacing property.

           Example : table{
                   table-spacing: 20px;
                    }
9.  To define special style for one particular table,the attribute which is to be added
     is called, id.

       Example :  #t1{
                    background-color: red;
                     }

               <table id="t1">
                <tr>
                   <th> abc</th>
                    </tr>
                 <tr>
                 <td> ddd</td>
                   </tr>
                 </table>    


10. The empty-cells property of CSS specifies whether the border should be displayed 
     if a cell is empty.
           table {
            empty-cells:show;
              }


CSS COLOUR 
-------------

1.  Various colours can be received by adding or subtracting lights of different colours.

2.  Two types of colour models are
            -----> Additive colour model  ( Red,Green,Blue model)
            -----> Subtractive colour model  ( Cyan,Magenta,Yellow model)


    Additive colour model                              Subtractive colour model

1.  Obtained by adding lights of different        1.  Obtained by subtracting lights of different 
    colours.                                          colours.

2.  The absence of all colours is black           2.  The absence of all colours is white.

3.  The presence of all colours is white.          3.  The presence of all colours is black.

4.  It works with emitted light.                  4.  It works with reflected light.

5. Used to dislay colours.                        5. Used to print colours.


3. Palette
   --------
   It is an indexed array of 256 entries representing the amount of RGB( 3 bytes each) to be used to 
    represent the pixel colour.( 2 to the power of 3 =8 bits for each colour)
              R              G                      B
     0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 -------------> Black
     0 0 0 0 0 0 0  1   0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1

    1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1     1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1   -----------> White

 

4.  Hi colour
    -------------
   It uses 16-bits to represent colour.

  Total number of colours which can be generated =   2 to the power of 16 = 64x 1024 colours

5.  True colour
    ---------------
     It uses 3bytes to represent colour.
 
     
  Total number of colours which can be generated =   2 to the power of 8 x 2 to the power of 8 x 2 to the power of 8

                                                 =  256 x 256 x 256 colours




6.            RGB colour model                       CMY colour model
           1.  Additive                             1. Subtractive
           2.  Used for computer dislays            2. Used for printing.
           3.  R+ G+B = White                       3. C + M + Y = Black



7.        C = 1-R, M = 1-G, Y = 1-B

8.       R = 1-C, G= 1-M, B = 1-Y 

9.       C + R = M + G = Y + B


10.     A particular way of using colours is called dithering.

11.    Primary colours are called gamut.

12.     The process of printing continuous images in newspapers,magazines and books is called halftoning.

13.      HSV model ---->  Hue , Saturation, Value  model

14.    HSL model  ---->   Hue, Saturation, Lightness model

15.   HSVA model --------->  Hue , Saturation, Value,Alpha model

16.  HSLA model  ---->   Hue, Saturation, Lightness,Alpha model


17. Hue is the property of light which easily describes whether a colour is red or blue or green.
    It can be referred as pure colour.

18. The intensity of colour in an image is called saturation.

19. Hue value is the value between 0 to 360 degree. 0 or 360 for red. 120 for green and 240 for blue.

20. Lightness is the property which measures the relative degree of black or white that has been mixed.
     Adding white makes the colour lighter and adding dark makes the colour darker.

21. The alpha is a number between o and 1. O is fully transparent and 1.0 is not  fully transparent( opaque).


22Q. If the RGB value is (0.2,0.7,1). Find the value in the CMY sace.


Ans:  C= 1-R = 1-0.2 =0.8
      M = 1-G = 1-0.7=0.3
      Y = 1-B = 1-1=0

      Therefore, CMY =(0.8,0.3,0)


23. The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.

24.  In the HTML document,we cannot have more than one element with the same id.

25.  The id is used to specify a specific style declaration in a style sheet.
 
26.  Rule for writing id in HTML is given below.
                          
                  #id-name
                    {
                     CSS properties;
                    }

27. The id name must not contain white space.


ORDERED LIST AND UNORDERED LIST USING CSS
-----------------------------------------

1.  There are two main categories of HTML as far as list is concerned.
       -------> Ordered list
       --------> Unordered list

2. In ordered list,the list items are marked with letters or numbers.
3.  In unordered list,the list items are marked with bullets.

4. The advantages of CSS list
   ---------------------------
    ----->  Set different list item markers for ordered list.
    ----->  Set different list item markers for unordered list.
    ----->  Set an image as the list item marker.
    ----->  Specifying background colours to lists and items associated with the list.

5. Different list properties of CSS
---------------------------------- 
     -->  list-style-type
     -->  list-style-image
     -->  list-style-position
     =->  Styling list different colours 


6.  The list-style-type property of CSS specifies the type of list item marker.

7.  The list-style-image property of CSS specifies an image in the list item marker.

8.  The list-style-position property of CSS specifies the position of the list item 
    markers.

9.  Any properties added to the <ol> or <ul> tag affects the entire list.

10.  Any properties added to the <li>  tag will affect the individual list items.
