ERRORS IN JAVASCRIPT
--------------------

1.  The statements which does not allow the program to run properly are called errors.

2.  The errors in JavaScript are as follows.

		---> Syntax error
                ----> Runtime error
                ----> Logical error

3. Syntax error
  -------------
   ---> The grammatical error in a program is called syntax error.
   ----> This error generated at interpretation time in JavaScript.

         Example : <sript> ------</sript> 

4. Runtime error
  ----------------
    ---> The statement which does not exist in the s/w and it is getting
         called by the compiler/interreter during execution of the program
         is called runtime error.
    ---> Runtime error are also called exception.
    ---> This error occurs during execution of the program.

        Example : <script>
                   window.alrt(" CUO");
                  </script>
            
             In the above example,the system is trying to call a method alrt
             which does not exist in the JavaScript.
           
               Note : The corrct method for window is alert.

5.  Logical error
    -------------
     ------->  The error which is neither syntax nor runtime,is called logical error.
     ------> This error is very hard  to find.
       ---> Logical error may be OK for system but it is not showing the output
            what is actually expected.

       Example :  Rice is eating Ram.
               The above sentence is correct for system but for the user the sentence 
                is wrong.
                   
               The correct sentence is Ram is eating rice.

6.  When executing JavaScript code, errors will definitely occur.

7.  These errors can be handled by the following exceptions.

			---> try
                        ----> catch
                        ---> throw
                        ----> finally


8. The statement which allows us to define a block of code to be tested for errors while
   it is being executed , is called try statement.

9. The statement which allows us to define a block of code to be executed if an error occurs in the 
   try block is called catch statement.

10. try and catch statement come in pairs.

		Example : try
                          {
                          code
                           ---
                           --
                           }
                         catch(err)
                         {
                        --------
                         code
                           ------
                          }

11. The statement which is used to throw errors which are in-built  throw statment.
   
12. Throw can throw number,string,boolean etc.

13. The statement which allows us to execute code after try and catch statement 
    regardless of the result is called finally statement.

    				try
                            { code
                           ---
                           --
                           }
                         catch(err)
                         {
                          code
                           ------
                          } 
                           finally {
                             code
                             ----
                              }
